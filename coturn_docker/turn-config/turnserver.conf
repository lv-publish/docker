########## coturn example configuration
# This file is mounted into the container at /etc/turn
# It contains the most relevant options for running coturn on a single Linux host

# Realm / authentication
realm=turn.suremeet.vn
# For quick testing you may keep user= entries. In production prefer use-auth-secret.
#user=root:123456

# External IP mapping (public/private)
external-ip=210.2.89.139/10.0.1.2

# Listening ports
listening-port=3478
tls-listening-port=5349
# Also enable HTTP/TLS ports for clients that use 80/443
listening-port=80
tls-listening-port=443

# Relay (media) port range
min-port=40000
max-port=65000

# TLS certificate paths (these are mounted from host's /etc/letsencrypt)

# Operational flags
no-multicast-peers

## Authentication: using a simple long-term credential for compatibility
# For quick testing keep a static user entry below. For production consider
# using --use-auth-secret + HMAC short-lived credentials instead.
user=root:123456

# Allow long UDP ports and more concurrent allocations if needed. Tune for your host.
